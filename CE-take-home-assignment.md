# Take-Home Assignment

In this round, we invite you to complete an assignment that evaluates your ability to perform tasks relevant to the role. Please submit Part 1 within 3 days (72 hours) after receiving. We'll schedule time to present Part 2 after the take-home assignment has been submitted. You can reach out to gchoi@2u.com with any questions. Good luck! We’re looking forward to seeing your great work.

## Scenario

In our Blended curriculum, students work through asynchronous content on their own and attend two in-person classes to review the material. We have gotten student feedback in our Blended curriculum about Module 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The student says:

“The activity code is broken and online module content is confusing. On top of that, the lesson is so boring and my instructor isn’t engaging. I feel like I’m behind and don’t know where to go from here.”

### Part 1: Fix the bug in the activity code

Given the activity instructions, activity code, and accompanying lesson plan, identify the bug(s) in the activity code. Fix the code and make changes to the lesson plan to address the fixed activity code. The activity instructions are provided for context on what the student is expected to do in this activity.

Submit your materials as a GitHub gist. This is due in 72 hours.

### Part 2: Presentation

The second part of the take-home assignment is a 45-minute presentation. You’ll have 10-15 minutes to present, and we’ll leave 15-30 minutes for questions. We’ll schedule the presentation with you after the take-home assignment has been submitted.

Given the [slide deck template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LSmNke6dNerLYUkWQK5yoPECeYSKatdaeQzCiB-c1QQ/edit?usp=sharing), create a presentation that explains the problem you solved, the solution to the problem, and next steps to take, if any.

Additionally, you should address the student's feedback about the confusing and boring nature of the online module lesson.
